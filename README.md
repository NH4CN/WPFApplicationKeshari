8-2 - Neelansh Updated README

- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?

This application is designed to be a student registration application so that users can register for courses.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this application?

For this application what I thought I did well was that being able to create an application using C# because the only programming language that I used to create applications and windows were using JAVA and JavaScript.

- Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI design keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Between the Console application and the WPF application is that the console design isn't interactive with the user as the WPF application. To support user needs and interaction I had to make an UI that is user interactable. This design of using WPF for user interaction helped keep users in mind and made it user first and they have full control of their registration and design wise it is cleaner with a drop down for the courses with a button for registering courses.

- How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

I first looked at my console code and then added an array so that it shortens the program and instead of printing each and every course one by one I can use a foreach command so that I can write each course with one or two lines of code made the application runs better and compiles faster.

- Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

At some point during the development process of the application when I tried to run the program it would show an error that my file was not found. I then had to open a new application and copy and paste the code and re-run the program.
